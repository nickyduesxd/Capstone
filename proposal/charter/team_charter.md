# Team Charter
## Individual Commitment
Elgendy: Currently holds SL position and has time to commit to the capstone however has to fulfill Cyber Operation requirements.
Zayfman: Currently I have 2 work intensive billets and am working to apply to graduate school. Once the application for graduate school is done I will have more time to commit to the Capstone.
## Missed Deadlines
If a team member misses a deadline then we will host a meeting to discuss what's going on and come up with a course of action. If needed to escalate then we will have a mediator present.
## Unacceptable Work/Performance: How will your team deal with an underperforming teammate?
If a team member turns in unacceptable work, then the team will have a team meeting to discuss what went wrong and how we can improve as a team. More specific guidelines for expectations will be set. After that, the owner of the work will be granted 24 hours to fix the work to make it acceptable for the project.
## Other Concerns
We both do not have any formal experience with Software Designed Networks.
