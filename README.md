# Marine Corps Marathon Medical Communications System

## Group Members
- Zeyad Elgendy (Cyber Operations Major)
- Nicholas Zayfman (Computer Science Major)

## Description
The Marine Corps Marathon currently uses a HAM radio system in order to communicated medical information. 
We are tasked with designing a new system to replace the current one.
This project is complicated given the high attendance for this event as well as the location (Washington D.C.) where
security is hightened and surrounds sensitive areas such as the Pentagon and the route is in a city.

## Current Steps
- Editing Research Paper draft
- Working on UI (Development- working on code and writing tests)
- Ordered Nodes for network
- Creating project Presentation (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x1Ycq-gV-lEZHK0Q1es8ILs1GWJiPB6k/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114198364629307238569&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## What we have accomplished so far.
- Completed Literature Review
- Completed Movement order to USMC Marathon 27OCT24
- Completed Computer Science Capstone Proposal and recieved approval
- Completed Research Paper Draft and recieved feedback from faculty
- Presented Capstone Proposal to both Computer Science and Cyber Operations sections
