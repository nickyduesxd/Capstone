## Description
The Marine Corps Marathon currently uses a HAM radio system in order to communicated medical information. 
We are tasked with designing a new system to replace the current one.

security is hightened and surrounds sensitive areas such as the Pentagon and the route is in a city.

## Current Steps
- Writing Draft of Paper for Cyber Operations Major requirement
