## Description
The Marine Corps Marathon currently uses a HAM radio system in order to communicated medical information. 
We are tasked with designing a new system to replace the current one.
This project is complicated given the high attendance for this event as well as the location (Washington D.C.) where
security is hightened and surrounds sensitive areas such as the Pentagon and the route is in a city.
